## üß© Use Your Own Database

You can create your own `.json` question file and point the program to it (by changing the `JSON_FILENAME` variable or replacing the sample file).

### **Supported structure:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "type": "crocette",
    "question": "Example multiple-choice question?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Option 1",
      "B": "Option 2",
      "C": "Option 3",
      "D": "Option 4",
      "E": "Option 5"
    },
    "answer": "B"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "type": "dariempire",
    "question": "The capital of Italy is ________.",
    "answer": "Rome"
  }
]
```
- **type:** `"crocette"` (multiple choice) or `"dariempire"` (fill-in)
- **options:** Only for multiple choice, always 5 options (A-E)
- **answer:**  
    - A single letter (`"B"`) or a comma-separated string for multiple correct answers (`"B,D"`)
    - For fill-in questions, the correct word or phrase (`"Rome"`)

## üåç Example file

The included `geography.json` file contains several geography questions (multiple choice and fill-in).  
You can use it as a template to create more question sets (e.g., history, science, etc.).
